<h1>TCSS445 Spring 2025 Project: RV Solutions</h1>
<p>We are trying to create a database for a car management rental system. This allows us to organize our data and prevent miscommunication in the availability of cars, ensuring business operates as nominal. We want to improve our knowledge of working with databases, since it is an important concept in virtually every software used today. Want to add more flexibility for users than existing solutions and allow users to host their own RV on the same platform. </p>
